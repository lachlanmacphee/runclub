          <h2>Where can I run with a group in Melbourne?</h2>
          <p>
            Every Tuesday night you can run at Albert Park Lake, South
            Melbourne, with the Gunn Runners. We meet at the Limerick Arms Hotel
            (corner of Clarendon and Park St) at 6:15pm.

            You&nbsp;don't&nbsp;need to join Gunn Runners, everyone is welcome.
            &nbsp;Your first run with us is free (normally it is a nominal fee

            Sacred Heart Mission) or returned to members via subsidised social
            events.
            <span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>
            We are a not-for-profit incorporated association.

          <h2>What is the history of Gunn Runners?</h2>
          <p>
            Originally set up 18 years ago by a group of friends, the Gunn
            Runners met at the Gunn Island Hotel once a week for a simple "Run
            and a Beer". The format remains much the same, with the group now
            meeting at the Limerick Arms Hotel in South Melbourne.
